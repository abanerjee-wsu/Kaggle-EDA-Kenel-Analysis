# Kaggle-EDA-Kernel-Analysis
This project was an attempt to answer some the intriguing question from Kaggle Kernel submission.
We all refer to Kaggle projects for EDA challenges and solutions. However, we would like to answer the following questions for which there seems to be no easy answer in the existing web sources;

#1 For EDA which language is mostly used? Python, R, Julia etc in Kaggle database
#2 Over a period of time, which language is trending up or down?
#3 Which packages are more popular in Python Kernels ? NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn etc
#4 Which method (api) calls in a particular package are more frequent? 
#5 Best voted EDA scientists are from which geographical location?
